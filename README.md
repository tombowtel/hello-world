# hello-world

Just another repository

I love :coffee: :pizza:, and :dancer:.

$ git clone https://github.com/gcswebdesignyear2/curriculum.git.

# adds all files that are in your current directory and which you've

# recently changed to the "staging area" (ie. they're "ready to commit")

$ git add -A

# commits all the "staged" files into your local repository

$ git commit -m "update README"

# pushes your local repository up to your remote one on Github

$ git push origin master
